# CroustiPays
A simple mobile app created using Android Studio (school project).  
We used both the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps?hl=fr) to display markers on each country, providing information about their respective populations.  
You can also bookmark your favorite countries and they will be saved locally on your phone !
